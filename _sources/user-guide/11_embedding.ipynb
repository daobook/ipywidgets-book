    "# Embedding Jupyter Widgets in Other Contexts than the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "参考：[Embedding Jupyter Widgets in Other Contexts than the Notebook](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/embedding.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter interactive widgets can be serialized and embedded into\n",
    "\n",
    " - static web pages\n",
    " - sphinx documentation\n",
    " - html-converted notebooks on nbviewer\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we discuss embedding widgets using the custom widget manager in the `@jupyter-widgets/html-manager` npm package. Two embedders are provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A basic embedder that only embeds standard controls, but can be used on any web page\n",
    "2. An embedder that uses RequireJS, and can embed standard and custom widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Embedding Widgets in HTML Web Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic notebook interface provides a `Widgets` menu for generating an HTML snippet\n",
    "that can be embedded into any static web page:\n",
    "\n",
    "The menu provides three sets of actions\n",
    "\n",
    " - Save Notebook Widget State and Clear Notebook Widget State\n",
    " - Download Widget State\n",
    " - Embed Widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save Notebook Widget State\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook file may be saved with the current widget state as metadata. This allows the notebook file to be rendered with rendered widgets (see the section about Sphinx below, for example). To save a notebook with the current widget state, use the `Save Notebook Widget State` menu item.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to delete old saved state and save new state to the notebook, do the following in order:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `Clear Notebook Widget State` menu and save the notebook. This clears the metadata from the notebook file.\n",
    "2. Restart the kernel and refresh the page. This clears the old widget state from the widget manager on the page.\n",
    "3. Create whatever widgets you'd like, and use `Save Notebook Widget State` and save the notebook. This saves the new widget state to the notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddable HTML Snippet\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Embed widgets` menu item provides a dialog containing an HTML page\n",
    "which embeds the current widgets. In order to support custom widgets, it uses the RequireJS embedder.\n",
    "\n",
    "This HTML snippet is composed of multiple `<script>` tags embedded into an HTML document:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The first script tag loads RequireJS from a CDN. If you already have RequireJS on the page, you can delete this script tag.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The second script tag loads the RequireJS widget embedder. This defines appropriate modules and then sets up a function to render all of the widget views included on the page. If you are only embedding standard widgets and do not want to use RequireJS, you can replace these first two script tags with a script tag loading the standard embedder.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The next script tag is a script tag with mime type\n",
    "   `application/vnd.jupyter.widget-state+json` that contains the state of all\n",
    "   the widget models currently in use. The JSON schema for the content of this\n",
    "   script tag is found in the `@jupyter-widgets/schema` npm package.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then there are a number of script tags, each with mime type\n",
    "  `application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json`, corresponding to the views which\n",
    "  you want to display on the web page. These script tags must be in the body of\n",
    "  the page, and are replaced with the rendered widgets. The JSON schema for the\n",
    "  content of these script tags is found in the `@jupyter-widgets/schema` npm\n",
    "  package.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The *Embed Widgets* action currently creates one of these script tags for each\n",
    "  view displayed in the notebook. If you'd like to lay out the views, or include\n",
    "  only some of them, you can delete or include these script tags as you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to clear widget state from the frontend so that it does not show up in the embedding, restart the kernel and then refresh the page, in that order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Widget State JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Download Widget State` option triggers the downloading of a JSON file\n",
    "containing the serialized state of all the widget models currently in use, using\n",
    "the `application/vnd.jupyter.widget-state+json` format specified in the\n",
    "`@jupyter-widgets/schema` npm package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddable code for the widgets can also be produced from Python. The\n",
    "`ipywidgets.embed` module provides several functions for embedding widgets\n",
    "into HTML documents programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `embed_minimal_html` to create a simple, stand-alone HTML page:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from ipywidgets import IntSlider\n",
    "from ipywidgets.embed import embed_minimal_html\n",
    "\n",
    "slider = IntSlider(value=40)\n",
    "embed_minimal_html('export.html', views=[slider], title='Widgets export')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates the stand-alone file `export.html`. To view the file, either\n",
    "start an HTTP server, such as the [HTTP\n",
    "server](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/http.server.html#module-http.server)\n",
    "in the Python standard library, or just open it in your web browser (by\n",
    "double-clicking on the file, or by writing `file:///path/to/file` in your\n",
    "browser search bar).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will sometimes want greater granularity than that afforded by\n",
    "`embed_minimal_html`. Often, you want to control the structure of the HTML\n",
    "document in which the widgets are embedded. For this, use `embed_data` to get\n",
    "JSON exports of specific parts of the widget state. You can embed these in an\n",
    "HTML template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "from ipywidgets import IntSlider\n",

    "The web page needs to load RequireJS and the Jupyter widgets HTML manager.\n",
    "You then need to include the manager state in a `<script>` tag of type\n",
    "`application/vnd.jupyter.widget-state+json`, which can go in the head of the\n",
    "document. For each widget view, place a `<script>` tag of type\n",
    "`application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json` in the DOM element that should\n",
    "contain the view. The widget manager will replace each `<script>` tag with\n",
    "the DOM tree corresponding to the widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we used a Python string for the template, and used the\n",
    "`format` method to interpolate the state. For embedding in more complex\n",
    "documents, you may want to use a templating engine like\n",
    "[Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also change the CDN from its default of jsdelivr to use unpkg by setting the\n",
    "`data-jupyter-widgets-cdn` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, we only load modules from the CDN by setting the\n",
    "`data-jupyter-widgets-cdn-only` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all embedding functions in `ipywidgets.embed`, the state of all widgets\n",
    "known to the widget manager is included by default. You can alternatively\n",
    "pass a reduced state to use instead. This can be particularly relevant if you\n",
    "have many independent widgets with a large state, but only want to include\n",
    "the relevant ones in your export. To include only the state of specific views\n",
    "and their dependencies, use the function `dependency_state`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "from ipywidgets.embed import embed_minimal_html, dependency_state\n",
    "\n",
    "s1 = IntSlider(max=200, value=100)\n",

    "## Embedding Widgets in the Sphinx HTML Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "As of ipywidgets 6.0, Jupyter interactive widgets can be rendered in Sphinx html\n",
    "documentation. Two means of achieving this are provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the Jupyter Sphinx Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "The [jupyter_sphinx](https://jupyter-sphinx.readthedocs.io) extension\n",
    "enables jupyter-specific features in sphinx. It can be installed with `pip` and\n",
    "`conda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `conf.py` sphinx configuration file, add `jupyter_sphinx`\n",
    "to the list of enabled extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then use the `jupyter-execute` directive to embed the output of code execution\n",
    "in your documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "```rst\n",
    ".. jupyter-execute::\n",
    "\n",
    "  from ipywidgets import VBox, jsdlink, IntSlider, Button\n",
    "  s1, s2 = IntSlider(max=200, value=100), IntSlider(value=40)\n",
    "  b = Button(icon='legal')\n",
    "  jsdlink((s1, 'value'), (s2, 'max'))\n",
    "  VBox([s1, s2, b])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `nbsphinx` Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The [nbsphinx](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/) Sphinx extension\n",
    "provides a source parser for `*.ipynb` files. Custom Sphinx directives are used\n",
    "to show Jupyter Notebook code cells (and of course their results) in both HTML\n",
    "and LaTeX output.\n",
    "In the case of the HTML output, Jupyter Interactive Widgets are also supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "For notebooks that are executed by `nbsphinx` the widget state is automatically\n",
    "generated.\n",
    "For others, it is a requirement that the notebook was correctly saved with the\n",
    "special \"Save Notebook Widget State\" action in the widgets menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessary JavaScript code is automatically embedded in the generated HTML\n",
    "files.\n",
    "A custom URL or a local JavaScript file can be specified with the\n",
    "`nbsphinx_widgets_path` configuration option.\n",
    "For more configuration options, have a look at the\n",
    "[documentation](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/usage.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rendering Interactive Widgets on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "If your notebook was saved with the special \"Save Notebook Widget State\" action\n",
    "in the Widgets menu, interactive widgets displayed in your notebook should also\n",
    "be rendered on nbviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "See e.g. the [Widget List](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Widget%20List.ipynb)\n",
    "example from the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Case of Custom Widget Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom widgets can also be rendered on nbviewer, static HTML and RTD\n",
    "documentation. An illustration of this is the http://jupyter.org/widgets\n",
    "gallery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The widget embedder attempts to fetch the model and view implementation of the\n",
    "custom widget from the npm CDN https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm by default. The URL that is requested\n",
    "for, e.g. the `bqplot` module name, with the semver range `^2.0.0` is\n",
    "\n",
    "`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bqplot@^2.0.0/dist/index.js`\n",
    "\n",
    "which holds the webpack bundle for the bqplot library.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the default CDN is using https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm it can be configured by\n",
    "setting the optional `data-jupyter-widgets-cdn` attribute for script tag which loads `embed-amd.js`,\n",
    "as shown in the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the default strategy is loading modules from the same site, and then\n",
    "falling back to CDN. This can be configured by setting the optional\n",
    "`data-jupyter-widgets-cdn-only` attribute for script tag which loads `embed-amd.js`\n",
    "as shown in the example above too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [widget-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyter/widget-cookiecutter)\n",
    "template project contains a template project for a custom widget library\n",
    "following the best practices for authoring widgets, which ensure that your\n",
    "custom widget library can render on nbviewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using `jupyter-widgets-controls` in web contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "The core `jupyter-widgets-controls` library, the JavaScript package of ipywidgets, is\n",
    "agnostic to the context in which it is used (Notebook, JupyterLab, static web\n",
    "page). For each context, we specialize the base widget manager implemented in\n",
    "`@jupyter-widgets/base` to provide the logic for\n",
    "\n",
    " - where widgets should be displayed,\n",
    " - how to retrieve information about their state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The `widgetsnbextension` Python package provides the implementation of a specialized widget\n",
    "   manager for the classic Jupyter notebook, and the packaging logic as a notebook\n",
    "   extension.\n",
    " - The `@jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager` npm package provides the implementation of a specialized widget\n",
    "   manager for the context of `JupyterLab`, and the packaging logic as a lab\n",
    "   extension.\n",
    " - The embed manager implemented in the `@jupyter-widgets/html-manager` npm package is a specialization of\n",
    "   the base  widget manager used for the static embedding of widgets used by\n",
    "   the `Sphinx` extension, `nbviewer`, and the \"Embed Widgets\" command\n",
    "   discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide [additional examples](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/tree/master/examples) of specializations of the base widget manager\n",
    "implementing other usages of Jupyter widgets in web contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The [`web1`](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/tree/master/examples/web1) example is a simplistic example showcasing the use of\n",
    "   Jupyter widgets in a web context.\n",
    "2. The [`web2`](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/tree/master/examples/web2) example is a simple example making use of the\n",
    "   `application/vnd.jupyter.widget-state+json` mime type.\n",
    "3. The [`web3`](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/tree/master/examples/web3) example showcases how communication with a Jupyter kernel can\n",
    "   happen in a web context outside of the notebook or jupyterlab contexts.\n",
    "4. The [`web-tmpnb`](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/tree/master/examples/web-tmpnb) example makes use of the `tmpnb` service to spawn a Jupyter\n",
    "   server, request a kernel from this server and implement the same feature as\n",
    "   the `web3` example."
